How can you optimize processor time with Node.js? Discover how Node.js operates in a non-blocking manner and how to handle the result from a network call. Explore the advantages and challenges associated with using anonymous callback functions. Use Node.js to parse JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data from a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) message.

**Learning Objectives**

- Explain the concept of asynchronous callback functions.

- Explain the difficulties with nested callbacks and inversion of control.

- Create a callback function to intercept HTTP method calls.

- Describe how the JavaScript promise object represents the eventual compconstion of an asynchronous operation and its return value.

- Parse JSON data from an HTTP message.
