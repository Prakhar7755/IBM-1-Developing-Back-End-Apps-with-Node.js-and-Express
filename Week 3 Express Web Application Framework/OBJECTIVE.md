When you use Node.js to build a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) server, you will discover that the default Node.js framework is low-level. You can extend its features with third-party packages such as Express. Get hands-on experience with the Express web application framework by creating a web server that listens to incoming requests. You also learn how to implement authorization with Express. Use routing, middleware, and template rendering to extend the Node.js framework and handle dynamic content.
