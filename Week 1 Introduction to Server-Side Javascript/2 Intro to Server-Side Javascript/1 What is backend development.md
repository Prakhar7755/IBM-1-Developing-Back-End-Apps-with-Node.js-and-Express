Welcome to “What is backend development?” After watching this video, you will be able
to: Define backend development Differentiate between frontend and backend
technologies Explain the components of the backend of a
web application Describe the importance of a robust, scalable
backend Client-server applications such as cloud-based
and web applications generally consist of a “frontend” and a “backend.” The frontend runs on the client machine, and the backend runs on a server. The client machine runs the web browser and
the web browser’s engine. The browser’s engine is what communicates
with the backend. Backend developers work on the technologies
that ensure a website performs correctly, part of which includes writing the code that
communicates with the browser’s engine and the backend server. Furthermore, backend development refers to
the development of the server-side logic, including the code that pertains to databases,
servers, and applications. Backend technologies include servers, databases,
web APIs, programming languages, frameworks, and runtimes. Servers consist of hardware, software, or
both that communicate with and provide functionality to a client. Servers may also communicate with and provide
functionality to each other. There are many types of servers. Web applications often use many types of servers,
including database servers, application servers, and web servers. Let’s briefly discuss each of these types
of servers. The database server is the machine and the
application that houses, retrieves, and delivers data. The terms “database server” and “database”
are often used interchangeably. Web servers ensure client requests are responded
to, often using hypertext transfer protocol or HTTP for short. An HTTP server is part of the software running
on a web server. The software part of a web server is what
controls how a user accesses files hosted on the server. Application servers host and deliver a business
application through HTTP. They sit between a database server and a web
server. Application servers transform data into dynamic
content and run the business logic, which is the data storage and transfer rules. Servers must communicate with each other as
well as the frontend in a client-server architecture. APIs, which stands for “application programming
interface,” allow two pieces of software to communicate with each other. A web service is a type of web API. A web service communicates using HTTP requests. In other words, the web service is the programming
interface that sends and receives requests using HTTP among web servers and the client. Backend programming languages are the languages
that developers use to make the servers function. These languages include JavaScript, PHP, Python,
Ruby, Java, and C-sharp. Frameworks provide structure for the code. An application can be built and deployed using
a framework. The framework often generates code that cannot
be altered to perform common tasks. Some common backend frameworks include Django,
a Python framework, Ruby on Rails, a Ruby framework, and Express.js a JavaScript framework. Express.js is a framework running on top of
node.js that handles HTTP requests made to a web server. Let’s discuss runtime environments. A runtime behaves similarly to a mini operating
system that provides the resources necessary for an application to run. The runtime is the infrastructure that supports
the execution of a codebase. It is the hardware and software environment
in which an application gets executed. Node.js is an example of a backend runtime
environment. The reason Node.js has become so popular as
a backend technology is because it runs on Google Chrome’s open-source V8 engine, the same engine that runs the browser on the
frontend. Moreover, most modern browsers such as Microsoft
Edge and Opera also run on the V8 engine. Node.js makes it very easy for the frontend
to communicate with the backend. Node.js executes JavaScript. Recall from a previous course that JavaScript
is widely used on the frontend. This makes JavaScript a handy language for
web developers to learn because of its use both on the frontend and the backend. Another issue backend developers need to be
concerned with is scalability. Scalability is essential for enterprise software
success and is the responsibility of the backend which is affected by the load on an application. Load refers to the number of concurrent users,
the number of transactions, and the amount of data transferred back and forth between
the clients and servers. Web applications should be scalable. Scalability is the application’s ability
to dynamically handle the load as it grows or shrinks without it affecting the application’s performance. Scalability is essential for the success of
a client-server application. Lastly, other backend responsibilities include
security, authentication, and prevention of malware attacks. The backend is also mainly responsible for
performance because it retrieves and transfers data between machines, delivers content to
the front end, and supplies the business logic of the application. In this video, you learned that Backend development refers to the development
of the server-side logic, including the code that pertains to databases, servers, and applications. Frontend technologies are those that pertain
to the client, such as the interface and the web browser. Backend technologies include various types
of servers and supporting infrastructures such as programming languages, frameworks,
and other hardware. The backend is responsible for scalability,
security, and performance.
