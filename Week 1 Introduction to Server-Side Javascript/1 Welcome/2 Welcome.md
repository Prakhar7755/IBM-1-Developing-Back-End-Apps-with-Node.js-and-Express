## Welcome
Welcome to Developing Back-end Apps with Node.js and Express. In this four-week class, expect to spend approximately 3-4 hours per week on it. In week one, you will be introduced to Node.js and server-side JavaScript. In week two, you learn about asynchronous programming using callback functions. In week three, you learn about the Express web application Framework. During week four, you develop a book review application project to be reviewed by your peers. Throughout the course, you will have ample time to practice and hone your skills with hands-on labs.

To be successful in this course and become adept with using Node.js and Express, you should:

-   watch all videos
-   take the practice and graded quizzes
-   complete the hands-on labs
-   complete the final project
-   peer-review two of your classmateâ€™s projects
-   periodically review the discussion forums

Please use the discussion forum if you get stuck or want to discuss content further.

Have fun learning about Node.js and Express!
