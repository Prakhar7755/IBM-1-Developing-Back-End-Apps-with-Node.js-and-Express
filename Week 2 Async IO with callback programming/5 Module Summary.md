Module Summary
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:

- Asynchronous network operations can be handled using callback functions in order to prevent blocking JavaScript code

- A callback function must invoke another callback function to pass a message from the Node.js module back to the main application after the Node.js module receives a response message

- Nested callbacks can be difficult to read and debug. Inversion of control causes trust issues when dealing with third-party code

- Promise objects are most useful for operations that are time-consuming and can block resources

- JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() are two methods used to parse JSON objects
